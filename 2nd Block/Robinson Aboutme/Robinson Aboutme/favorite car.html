		This page is going to be about the Nissan Gtr sports car. The gtr is a hand built 2 
		door sports car revealed in 2007. Even though the gtr is a soprts car it is one of
		the best because of its all wheel drive feature. The stock Nissan gtr is capable of going 
		0 to 60 mile per hour in 2.9 seconds.

				The Gtr was first created in Febuary of 1969 at a tokyo motor show it was introduced
				as a 4 door sports car it was called the nissan Skyline gtr, the second generation was made shortly after this. 
				After a 16 year break they finally created a 3rd generation of the gtr they created it becasue the company
				found interest in group A racing. 
				More generatins of the car were created but in 2007 is when the car really took off with performance
				with a 0.27 of drag and a twin turbo engine and 588 nm of torque, this all heled redefine the launch
				control system forever. 
				since then there hasnt been a new generation released but rather some slight changes done too the car
				these incude a new grille, headlights, vented hood, chin spoiler, side skirts, and a new rear bumper.
