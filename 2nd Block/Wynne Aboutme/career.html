						Computer & information research scientists invent and design new technology and find new uses for existing technology. They study and solve complex problems in computing for business, science, medicine, and other uses. Most work for computer systems design and related services firms, scientific research and development companies, or the federal government. Computer and information research scientists held about 26,700 jobs in 2012. The job outlook (2014-24) is 11%. The median pay is $110,620 per year, and $53.18 per hour.

						Most computer and information research scientists need a Ph.D. in computer science or a related field, like computer engineering. A Ph.D. usually requires 4-5 years of study after the bachelor's degree, typically in a computer-related field, like computer science or information systems. During the first 2 years in a Ph.D. program, students take a variety of computer science classes. They then choose a specialty and spend the remaining years doing research within that specialty. Computer scientists who work in a specialized field may need knowledge of that field. For example, those working on biomedical applications may have to take some biology classes.
