Family is a strong bond between someone. You don't have to be born under the same blood line to be famiy. Family is someone who you love and would stand up for and be there when they need you most. That is why I am so thankful for the family that I have! Not just my brothers and sisters and cousins and people like that, but also my brothers and sisters who aren't really my family but would have my back just like they were! That is why I chose a page just for family because they mean the world to me and deserve more than just a web page but this is the best i can offer in the moment!</h4>
