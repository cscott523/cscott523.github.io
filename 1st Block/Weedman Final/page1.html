   <p align="middle">In your mall there is going to be alot of presents for your kids you can buy them at a lower price then what you would pay at walmart. So if I was you I would cme to your local mall and get your gifts there! This could look the inside of your mall if you havent went to your mall yet than I would suggest going to see what the inside of your local mall look's like!! I went to my local mall a ouple of days ag and it was packed with people and decorations it was pretty in the mall! I do think that if you go to your local mall then you will probably see the biggest christmas tree you have ever seen I do believe that malls all ver the worl compete to see who can have the biggest tree in their mall!!</p>
