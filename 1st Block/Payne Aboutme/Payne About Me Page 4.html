<h3>I have chose the job of being a web designer. A web designer is in charge of creating the way a website looks. they make logos, banners, and different graphics. They determine where to put the text and they structure the way you get from page to page. A designer needs to create a good looking and functioning site. They work closely with marketing teams and brand companies.</h3>
