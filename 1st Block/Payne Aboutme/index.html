<br>

<h3>My family is pretty crazy at times but we get along, unless we do something mom doesn't like. I have 2 sisters and they used to get on my nerves when I was younger but now we barley argue. My dad is pretty fun to be around he always makes at least one joke about me every day, he always liked to joke around with everyone. He used to have a quick temper little things would get him going on a rampage, I guess that's where I get it from cause im the same way. But he has gotten mellow over the years, still gets mad but not as much. My mom believe it or not now a days is the one that punishes us the most. We learned a long time ago that whenever we wanted somwting to go to dad cause he would more than likely say yes. It seemed like mom always said no to everything cause she knew that we would end up getting into trouble. My family has there up's and down's, but in the end we are always going to be there for each other.</h3>
		 
<h3>I had 3 grandpa's, 2 of them passed away and those were the only 2 that actually cared for me any. But it's whatever I don't need a grandpa to carry on with my life. I still have all my grandma's, they are all nice to me they actually care for me some. My cousins are the craziest people you'll ever meet. We normally hang out at our grandmas house but we occasionally go to each others house. They are normally the one's that get me into trouble like lighting fire crackers and throwing them on people's door's and running away or sneaking out at night and climbing onto the roof of her house and jumping around and stuff. We almost always get away with everything and my grandma doesn't know that we do stuff, hopefully she doesn't find out. It can get pretty chaotic especially for my grandma, she has to put up with all of us at once but we know she loves us cause even though we are hard to handle we are always there for each other.</h3>

<h3>See the thing about my family is know one else really understands how we are. They might think they do but they don't. We have different ways that we do certain things, you could almost say we are a pretty weird family cause of the way we are and to tell you the truth we are. It's actually kinda weird cause half of my family is the type that goes to church and is very religous, that's my mom's side. Then the other half just like to be wild and party a lot, that's my dad's side. Then there is my dad, mom, sister's, and me. We are kinda stuck in the middle of being religous and partying. I'm not really the religous type, don't get me wrong I believe in God I just don't like talking about it.</h3>
