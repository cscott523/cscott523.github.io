<h3>It seems like I have a different hobby every month. Right now my hobby is rc cars, I love rc cars they are so much fun to play with. For those of you who don't know what a rc car is, it's a miniture car that you control with a remote. Some of them can go up to 100 mph and some of them can even go over that but you have to upgrade it for it to be that fast. Another hobby of mine is bmxing. I have a X-Games bmx bike it's red and black but it's broke right now so until I get it fixed i'm gonna stick to rc cars.</h3>
