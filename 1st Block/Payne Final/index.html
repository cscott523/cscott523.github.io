<h3>What is the meaning of Christmas? To me it means being able to spend time with family and friends. To others it might mean sadness because they can't buy any presents for their children. Others might be upset cause they don't get to see there loved one's on Christmas. Honestly I think I can do without presents on Christmas cause that's not what it's really about. No, what Christmas is really about, the true meaning of it is the birth of Jesus Christ.</h3>

<h3>I think my favorite part of Christmas is putting up the tree with my family cause we are all together and we all get along and laugh and share good times with each other. Plus we get to eat and that is a pretty good part about that to.</h3>

<h3> I love spending time with my family on Christmas Eve, everybody usually goes to my grandma's and hangs out and opens some presents and just has a good time. It's also a time where my uncle usually likes to prank people so it's kinda hard not to keep my mind off of that. Christmas Eve is all about anticapation. Because you are wanting to open your presents but you have to wait until Christmas Day.</h3>
