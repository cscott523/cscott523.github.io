							<p><CENTER><H2>My puppy's name is ACE he's a yellow lab mix with something else. <br>
							He's 15 weeks old and a spoil little puppy. He gets so much attention from everyone.<br>
							I got ace when he was 7 weeks old, I basically save his life. My girlfriend friend had him but we knew she wasn't going to take care of him. <br>
							So we talk to my girlfriend friend about she giving it to us and she was saying no, at the beggining but we talk to her into it. <br>
							We finally have him. He was somehow in bad conditions. He was full of fleas, really skinny for a puppy and he was hurting since he will pick on by the other dogs she had.<br>
							Now ace is really happy, well I think. We been trying to train him. So far he's somehow potty train and he knows the commant sit. <CENTER><H2><br>
