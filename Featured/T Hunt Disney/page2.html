			   <td colspan="2"><h3> <strong> <center>Disney World's History</center></strong> </h3>Disneyland had turned out to be a smashing success, however Walt Disney's dream to create the perfect theme park wasn't quite
               fullfilled in it. Seeing this, he decided to try once again to make his dream a reality. He knew that he would have to start on the
               east coast to prevent competition with Disneyland, so he set up dummy corporations to buy land in Florida, just outside of
               Orlando. Despite his efforts to keep it under wraps, people began to notice that 27,000 acres of land was bought in Florida and
               it was found out that Disney had purchased it. Unfortunately Walt Disney died before construction on Disney World could begin,
               Roy Disney, his brother, then took over and helped to complete the construction. They built canals to control the water, built their
               own energy plants, hotels, and food centers. The project ended up using 9,000 workers and $400 million when it was opened
               on October 1, 1971. Soon enough there were lines for miles around Disney World and it was apparent to all that Disney World was 
               successful.</td>
