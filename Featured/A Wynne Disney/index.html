Disneyworld is a very fun, exciting, and enjoyable place. I can say that as a fact because I have been there before. Kids love it, and there's so many fun things to see and do. You can meet all of the Disney characters, take pictures with them, and even have a conversation with them. There's so much you can do there. I went for a week and I didn't even do half of the things that're available for you to enjoy there. ther's something for every member in the family.

<p style="color:#696969">The Walt Disney World Resort that burst on the scene in the 1970s rapidly became the world’s best-known destination vacation resort with guests coming from all parts of the world.By 1982, Walt Disney World Resort had doubled its investment with the addition of Epcot, Walt Disney World Village and 6 resorts. Attendance had passed 100 million visitors.

         <p style="color:#696969">When Walt was alive, he used to stand at the exit of Disneyland wishing the guests a farewell at the end of the night.  NO ONE ever left the park before closing time.  One night, a family walked by and was leaving the park before closing time, and Walt stopped them.  He asked them why they were leaving early, worried that maybe a CM was rude or something bad happened.  They said everything was wonderful, but when they were on the skyride, they saw the highway and could see there was a lot of traffic.  They wanted to get a head start home to beat the traffic.  Walt would have none of it, so he decided that day that he would build a bigger park and make it a "world" instead of just a "land.”  He wanted it to be that once you enter Disney World you have no ties with the outside world. Since Disneyland is in the middle of the city and is so small, one couldn't do that. With a new world, you are engulfed in all that is Disney. Thus, the idea for Disney World was born.
