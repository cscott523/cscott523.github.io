<ul><li><h3><center>Turtle Talk with Crush (9/10)</center></h3><center>Kids interact with Crush from Finding Nemo in a screen-based attraction that mimics a water tank. The interactions are all about kids, and the “Living Character” Crush engages with kids excellently (really cool technology). We think Turtle Talk is just as enjoyable for adults, as part of the humor goes over kids’ heads, and there are a lot of “kids say the darndest things” type moments in every show. Don’t waste FastPass+ on this.</center><br />

<li><h3><center>The Seas with Nemo and Friends (7/10)</center></h3><center>A dark ride in The Seas pavilion with the Finding Nemo characters trying to find Nemo. A variety of technology is used here, and the coolest scenes are the Angler fish ‘chase’ (using the same type of KUKA arm as Sum of All Thrills) and the projections of fish into the Living Seas’ aquarium. Despite a couple of neat moments, the ride itself is a fairly uninspired CliffNotes version of the film. It’s short and although there’s nothing really objectionable about it, it’s also nothing memorable. However, it’s a short ride with a short line, so there’s no reason not to do it. Don’t bother with FastPass+ for it–do it whenever with minimal waits.</center><br />

<li><h3><center>IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth (10/10)</center></h3><center> Illuminations is the greatest fireworks show in the history of mankind. It’s actually also (sort of) about the history of mankind, humanity, and our visions of the future. At least, that’s what Disney claims. In actuality, Illuminations is a fireworks show with abstract themes that are easy to miss, with an absolutely beautiful soundtrack. It will appeal to everyone who likes fireworks, and will appeal even more to discerning guests for its music, symbolism, and themes. A fireworks show of this nature is probably not something that Disney would make today. It’s an all-around excellent show, and is definitely not to be missed. FastPass+ offers a good reserved seating section for Illuminations, so if you aren’t able to use FastPass+ for Soarin’ or Test Track for whatever reason, this would be our pick. Otherwise, stake out an unobstructed spot along World Showcase Lagoon at least 30 minutes in advance for it. You can read our Best IllumiNations Viewing Spots posts for a list of the best spots and other tips for viewing the show.</center><br />

<li><h3><center> Soarin' (9/10)</center></h3><center>This transplant from Disney's California Adventure park is more than just a hang-gliding simulator. It might actually be the most peaceful ride in all four parks (assuming you don't have a problem with heights). There's something extremely relaxing about gliding over aromatic orange groves with the wind blowing in your hair, or having your feet just about brush the waves of the Pacific. Just stick your "fashionable" Mickey Ears in the underseat compartment, sit back and enjoy.</center><br />

<li><h3><center>Jungle Cruise (7/10)</center></h3><center> The Jungle Cruise might not have the thrills of Star Tours or Expedition Everest, but it does have more of something than any other ride at Disney: puns. Walt Disney himself used to ride Disneyland's Jungle Cruise over and over just to hear the various captains' spiels. Laughing along with the other guests just adds to the ride's enjoyment. Besides, if you're going to take a cruise through the rivers of the world, what better guide could you have than one who knows where to find the backside of water?</center><br />

<li><h3><center>Disney & Pixar Short Film Festival (1/10)</center></h3><center>This is literally a bunch of cartoon shorts that also play on Netflix in a 3D theater. It replaced Captain EO, and hopefully is temporary. It gets 1 star because it offers air conditioning. Don’t do this unless another hobby of yours is setting fire to $100 bills.</center><br />

<li><h3><center>Ellen’s Energy Adventure (6/10)</center></h3><center>Film, followed by slow-moving ride through prehistoric scenes of dinosaurs, followed by another film, in the context of Ellen DeGeneres having a dream about playing energy-centric episode of Jeopardy. This is a very long attraction (~45 minutes), and while enjoyable, most guests won’t find it worth the time commitment. Kids may be scared by the dark, dinosaur filled scenes.</center><br />
