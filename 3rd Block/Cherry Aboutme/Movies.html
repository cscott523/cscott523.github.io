			<p>A veteran operator for an emergency call-center, Jordan (Halle Berry) saves lives daily as part of her job, but when a young woman's frantic report of a prowler ends tragically, Jordan is devastated. She decides to pack it in on the front lines and -- instead -- teach others the ropes of the high-pressure job. But when a call from a kidnapped teen (Abigail Breslin) comes in, Jordan takes charge as never before and turns the girl into a partner in helping to save her life.

			<p> The movie came out in 2004.The story is told on two levels - one is the present day when Allie and Noah have grown old and live in a home. The other is the story Noah reads from the notebook in which he tells how he and Allie met, fell in love, lost each other, and then found each other again. The end of their love story is tragically altered by Allie’s Alzheimer’s diagnosis. But even that has no power over their love

Hazel introduces her favorite novel to Gus and tells that she dreamed on having a conversation with the author, Van Houten, who lives in Amsterdam. Gus contacts him and Van Houten invites them to visit him in Amsterdam. They travel to Netherlands with Frannie where Hazel will learn that things are not like they seem to be.
