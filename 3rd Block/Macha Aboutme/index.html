		On June 2nd, 1999 I was born in a hospital in upper Michigan. I was raised in Amberg, Wisconsin.
		    I have three older sisters named Laura, Leah, and Liza. My name was supposed to be Levi so we'd all have names
		beginning with the letter "L" but my grandpa Kenneth died a month before i was born so they named me after him. 
		    My sisters and I all are born on months beginning with the letter "J", and my sister Leah and I were born on the 
		same day(June 2nd) 7 years apart.</p>
