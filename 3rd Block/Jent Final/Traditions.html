		 Christmas is celebrated many different ways in each part of the world. Here are a few examples of the way Christmas may be celebrated.</h1></center>
		 <font size="4em"><center><p>
		  Australia- Christmas comes towards the beginning of the summer holidays! Children in Australia have their summer holidays from mid December to early Febuary. Australians hang wreaths on their front doors and sometimes go out caroling on Christmas Eve. People also decorate their houses with Christmas Trees and Christmas lights.<br>
		 Brazil- Many Brazilian Christmas Traditions come from Portugal as Portugal rules Brazil for many years. Nativity scence, which are known as Presépio are very popular. They are set up in homes and churches all through December. Christmas plays called 'Os Pastores'(The Shepards) are also popular. Most people, especially Catholics, will go to a Madnight Mass service or Missa do Galo (Mass of the Roster). The mass normally finishes about 1:00am. After the Missa do Gallo there are often big firework displays and in big towns and cities there are Christmas Tree shaped displays of electric lights. In Brazil, Santa Claus if called Papai Noel and Bom Velhinho (Good Old Man). Sometimes children leave a sock near a window. If Papai Noel finds your sock, he'll exchange it for a present!<br>
		  China- In China, only about one percent of people are Christians, so most people only know a few things about Christmas. Because of this, Christmas is usually only celebrated in the major cities. In these big cities there are Christmas Trees, lights and other decorations in the streets and department stores. Santa Claus is called 'Shen Dan Lao Ren'. In Chinese Happy/Merry Christmas is 'Sheng Dan Kuai Le'. Only a few people in China, have Christmas Trees or even celebrate it at all! If people do have a tree, it is normally a plastic one and might be decorated with paper chains, paper flowers, and paper lanterns (they might also call it a tree of light). A tradition thats becoming popular, on Christmas Eve, is giving apples. Many stores have apples wrapped up in colored paper for sale. People give apples on Christmas Eve because in Chinese Christmas Eve is called "Ping'an Ye" meaning peaceful and quiet evening, which has been translated from the carol 'Silent Night.'<br>
		  Haiti- In Haiti, at the beginning of December, people start looking for Christmas Trees. They might cut pine branches or go to the market and get trees brought from the mountains. The trees are decorated with bright ornaments. At the bottom of the tree is a large nativity scene. French is the main language spoken in Haiti, so Happy/Merry Christmas is 'Joyeux Noël'. Some people speak Creole where it's 'Jwaye Nowe'. On Christmas Eve, children place thier newly cleaned shoes, filled with straw under the tree on the porch. They hope that Sant (called  'Tonton Nwèl') will remove the straw and put presents in and around the shoes. Often. lots of houses in neighborhoods are open with all lights on until about 3:00am! Children are normally allowed to go out and often parents don't know where they are in the early morning - the older children are expected to look after the younger ones! And children of all ages are allowed to drink 'Anisette', which is a slightly alcoholic drink that's made by soaking 'anise' leaves in rum and sweetening it with sugar. Some people go to a Midnight Mass church service, or you might go out carol singing. After the mass, people come home and eat the main meal called 'reveillon' (it's a French term meaning 'to wake up' and is what the main meal is also called in France). The meal normally starts in the early hours of Christmas morning and lasts until the dawn.<br>
