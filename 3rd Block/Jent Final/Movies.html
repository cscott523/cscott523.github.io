		 Top 10 Favorite Christmas Movies</h1></center>
		 <center> <font color="black" size="5em"><p>
		  Home Alone-A game changer for the Christmas-movie category: it has action, like a zip line to the neighbors' house.
		  <br>
		  Elf-It may star Will Ferrell as a dim-witted elf, but the movie's payoff is old-fashioned, familiar, and welcome.
		  <br>
		  National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation-Decking the halls and other traditions are all colossal failures for the Griswold family -- riotous because it hits close to home.
		  <br>
		  How the Grinch Stole Christmas-Boris Karloff's dulcet baritone lends sinister charm to everyone's favorite Who hater in this short, sweet Christmas special.
		  <br>
		  Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer-This sixties stop-motion-animation movie is impossibly cute, right down to Sam the Snowman.
          <br>		  
		  A Charlie Brown Christmas-Charlie Brown sets out to find the true meaning of Christmas in this animated anti-commercialism classic.
          <br>		  
		  It's a Wonderful Life-Whether or not you have your own guardian angel hovering, the lesson here is that it's not money that makes you rich.
          <br>		  
		  Miracle on 34th Street-Uplifting without being cloying. It's no wonder that this movie is a much-beloved holiday chestnut.
          <br>		  
		  A Christmas Story-This comedy satisfies two sets of audiences: kids (Ralphie gets his BB gun) and parents (it does exactly what they warned him it would).
          <br>		  
		  The Santa Clause-Tim Allen deconstructs Saint Nick -- and reconstructs his waistline -- as a hapless Santa in training.
