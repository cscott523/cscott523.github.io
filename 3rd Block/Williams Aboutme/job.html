				<p> I have worked at McDonald's since July, so for about four months. Since there aren't a lot of jobs in Allen County that hire at fifteen, and because my dad supervises fourteen surrounding McDonald's, I got this job pretty easily. </p>
				<p> Since I am not sixteen yet, I can only work every weekend, and on days school is out. For the most part, I enjoy working there. Most of the people I work with, are really nice and funny. Sometimes I clean the lobby, sometimes I stock everything, sometimes I run for drive thru, but my favorite thing I do and what I do most of the time, is take and run orders at the cash register. </p>
				<p> I really like working here because it's pretty easy, I don't have to get up as early as I do for school, and I get payed. Also, I mainly like it so much because I can work with the public, which helps improve my social skills. By working with the public, I am able to learn how to talk to people easier without being nervous, and I learn how to properly handle situations that involve yelling or rude remarks towards me. </p>
