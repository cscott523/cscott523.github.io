			"Web developers design and create websites. They are responsible for the look of the site.
			They are also responsible for the site’s technical aspects, such as its performance and capacity,
			which are measures of a website’s speed and how much traffic the site can handle.
			In addition, web developers may create content for the site."

			JOB OUTLOOK
				</h1>
				<p>
			Employment of web developers is projected to grow 27 percent
			from 2014 to 2024, much faster than the average for all occupations.
			
			  Employment of web developers is projected to grow as ecommerce continues 
			to expand. Online purchasing is expected to grow faster than the overall retail industry.
			As retail firms expand their online offerings, demand for web developers will increase.
			In addition, an increase in the use of mobile devices to search the web will lead to an increase
			in employment of web developers.
