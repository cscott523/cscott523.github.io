			Hello my name is Casandra i'm 18 years old. And i like to tell you some things
			about me for one my nickname is Cas. 
			For two years i travel across the county i have lived in some really cool places like 
			Tallahassee and Salt Lake City. That is just some of the big citys that i lived in. 
			During those two years that i was traveling i got see all kinds of cool thing. But also living 
			on the road dose have some down sides. I was eleven years old when i was told that i would
			have to leave all my friends. And that was not easy i always lived i a small town and leaving
			that unknown well it scary me alot. I was always shy around people i did not know and i 
			did not think that i was going to make any new friends.
			</p>
			<p>
			But i did make some new friends but they are no longer in my life but i am glad 
			that they were in the short time that we had. But also i did lose some good friends 
			when i did move back home. And that was in 2011 i made have lost some friends but have 
			made new friends with the friendship that can last a life time.
