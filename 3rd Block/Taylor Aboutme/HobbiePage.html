				<h1> Gaming </h1>
				
				<p>Gaming is something I do for fun and for a slight career. I play a game while recording it. After I finish recording I spruce it up a little in an editing software. After those 2 things are done, I create a thumbnail, or a picture to represent the video. Once those things are done I upload them to the internet.</p>
				
				<p> Occasionally I will change it up for my youtube channel and change the small intro video at the beginning. I create those in Blender a animating software. </p>

			<p>It is something to either waste time on or to have fun. Gaming can be catigorized in the useless things. In some cases it can be, especially the ones that make you angry and competitive. Nontheless, gaming can be a way to interact with other people on the internet or to actually learn more about yourself when you are given the option to customize a personal item in-game.</p>
