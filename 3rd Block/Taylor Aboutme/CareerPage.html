			<p>The job i would want to go into if I were given the oppurtunity to go and take a job as a Web Developer. Reason being it would be a slight challenge considering HTML and CSS are constantly changing basically every year. Tags are coming and going and the way it is used/coded. Plus I'd only have to go to college to get a job that can get me an estimate of 64,000 dollars a year. All I would have a to as  a web developer would be create the content. Measure the websites speed for all internet connections and computers. Along with see its technical aspects, and the look of the site.
