				<h2> Career's </h2>
			
				<p> Information Technology is a field that a small portion of people either enjoy, or work in and gain money from. Computer and Information Research Scientists are basically the highest paying bunch in the the Information Technology field. Computer and Information Research Scientists invent/design new things to compute technology. They also find new innovative uses for our tech today.</p> 
				
				<h2> Music </h2>
				
				<p> Music is something that let's our creativity as humans flow. It actually helps people learn. Keeps people focused and patient. Different kinds may push us away from reality. Depending on your style and taste, so to speak. We can get to the kinds of music I like later on. </p>
				
				<h2> Hobbies </h2>
				
				<p> Hobbies are a human like to do for fun. things we do to waste time or to get some simple entertainment. Hobbies create a way for people to either get out of the house, Or.. to stay in. If you want a straight definition of what a hobby is, it is "an activity done regularly in one's leisure time for pleasure." Or a small horse/pony. </p>
