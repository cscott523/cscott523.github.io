				<p style="text-align: center"> We should all know by now that Christmas is celebrated the 25th of December. There is a reason for Christmas being on this day that most people know about especially Christians. Christmas Day is celebrated on December 25th because it is the celebrations of the birth of Jesus Christ which I did mention on my other page. But there is a little more to it. The name Christmas comes from the Mass of Christ or in other words Mass of Jesus. But A Mass service is where Christians gather together and remember that Jesus died for everyone and came back to life. Thats where Christmas came from. "Christ-Mass", is the longer version of Christmas.</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: right">Mistletoe</h2>

				<p style="text-align: right"> So a big part of Modern American Tradition is to hang up a Mistletoe during the Holiday season. The Mistletoe is a plant hung agoodluck to the people in the house and pushed away evil spirits. But that wasn't really popular in the past few thousand years sadly. But todaybove a door from or at the top of a door. It was supposed to possess mystical power which brought people  it is hung up as a prank or something more Romantic. The reason it is used for romance it because in Norse mythology the Mistletoe was a sign of love. That is why people kiss under them.</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: left">Christmas Trees</h2>
				
				</font>
				
				<font size="5">
				
				<p style="text-align: left">A Christmas tree is something most families do if they celebrate Christmas. The Christmas tree was orignially a Evergreen Fir tree. That type of tree was used to celebrate winter festivals for thousands and thousands of years! It's very hard to explain why the trees were put in houses back in the 14th, 15th, and 16th century. Reason being, there are so many legends describing why and what a person was using the tree for.</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: right">Presents</h2>
				
				</font>
				
				<font size="5">
				
				<p style="text-align: right">Presents is something not everyone an recieve on Christmas day. Some people either can't afford it or don't even bother. But one of the main reasons presents are a thing connected with Christmas is because it reminds Christians the presents were given to Jesus by the Wise Men. The Wise Men were a group of distinguished foreiners who visited Jesus after he was born.</p>
