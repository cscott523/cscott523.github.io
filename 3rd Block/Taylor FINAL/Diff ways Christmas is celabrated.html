			<p>Christmas can be celebrated the original Christian way, On or before Christmas Day, Have a tree, Have presents under it, eat dinner and hang out with family. Then open the gifts in the morning. But some religious ways of doing it is Kwanzaa or Hanukkah, the most popular ways to celebrate it other than the original way. Hanukkah is the Jewish holiday commemorating the rededication of the holy temple. Kwanzaa is a celebration that is a week long and starts on December 26. Kwanzaa is celebrating the honors of African Heritage.</p>
			
			<p> Hanukkah  isn't just one day it's actually eight. And can also be called Chanukah. This Jewish celebration Hanukkah means dedication in Hebrew. it usually begins on the 25th of Kislev on the Hebrew calender. Which usually falls into November or December. This day is often called the Festival of Lights, the holiday is celebrated with the lighting of the Menorah, (seen below) tradition foods, gifts, and games.</p>

			<p> Kwanzaa us derived from the phrase "matunda ya kwanza" wihch means "first fruits"
				   in Swahili. Kwanzaa is celabrated differently by family. But celebrations often include certain songs and different dances. On each of the seven nights, the family gathers together and a child from the family and lights one of the candles on the Kinara or candleholder (seen below).
