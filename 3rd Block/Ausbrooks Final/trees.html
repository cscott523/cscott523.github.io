<h3>Even though most people know these trees as "christmas trees" and that is
<br> usually what they are called, these trees are actually named the "evergreen
<br> fir tree". They have usually been used to celebrate winter festivals for thousands
<br> of years. Some people had used branches of it to decorate their homes during
<br> the winter season. The reason behing this is it made them think of the upcoming 
<br>spring season. Others used Fir Trees to decorate their temples at the festival 
<br>of Saturnalia. Christians use it as a sign of everlasting life with God.
<br>
<br> Below you will see the trees that we have for sale here at Zack's Christmas Shop!
