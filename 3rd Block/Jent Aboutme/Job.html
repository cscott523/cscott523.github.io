      <p>
         Almost all of my time is spent at my jobs! I work 7 days a week, usually every week, so this is pretty much where I spend all of my "personal" time! I work 4 part-time jobs. I work at WVLE/WLCK, Frozen Yogurt and Cafe, Bookkeeping Plus and LuLu's Custom Design! So as you can see from just that, my life is very crazy with a crazy work schedule! I've worked at WVLE/WLCK for about a year and a half now, I've worked at Frozen Yogurt and Cafe for probably 3 months, Bookkeeping Plus for 2-3 months, and LuLu's Custom Design for probably a year now. My life is very work consumed, but I love it! Work until 8 or 9 everynight and going home to do homework and get in bed for school gets hard after a while, but it definitely pays off when I can buy stuff myself and not have to rely on everyone else to get it for me!
