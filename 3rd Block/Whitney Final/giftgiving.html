				During a week when so many Americans have experienced some combination of joy, rage,
 and frustration in seeking the perfect holiday gifts for their children, it seems appropriate to pause and ask: Where
 did the practice of giving Christmas gifts to children come from?
				
				Nor do presents seem to have a clear connection to Christian faith. Some American families have established a “three-gift” Christmas in an effort to link the practice to the generosity of the three wise men in the story of Jesus’s birth, but again no broad historical precedent exists for this link. In fact, religious leaders have long been more likely to decry the commercialization of Christmas as detracting from the true spirit of the holiday than to celebrate the delivery of purchased goods to middle-class or wealthy children. (Donating gifts to poor children is a different matter, of course, but that practice became common in the United States only after gift-giving at home became a well-established ritual.)
				
				Every year we have 
				trucks that can stop by your house and you can give food, toys, blankets, or whatever
you think of. These donations go to homes around the country the other people may not have a chance to get or have.This is a non-Profit Foundation.
