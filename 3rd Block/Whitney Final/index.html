				Christmas is celebrated on the 25th of December and commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ. The word Christmas is derived from the Old English word “Cristes maesse” which literally translates to Christ's Mass. Although no one knows for sure the exact date of Christ's birth, the date chosen to celebrate it is related to the Roman Saturnalia festival that lasted from the 17th -21st of December. This date was chosen somewhere during the 4th century AD by the heads of the church. The date became widely accepted by most branches of Christianity with the exception of the Armenians who reserved the 6th of January for Christmas celebrations.

				19th century It was around this time that the modern Christmas tree was introduced in Britain. The 20th century brought a general acceptance of the tradition despite the criticisms that were originally set against it.
				
				Santa Claus became a part of the Christmas tradition around the Middle Ages however, his part in Christmas was not popularized until after he was depicted as a jolly stout old man wearing a red and white suit in the 19th century. This figure of Santa was immediately captured by celebrants all over. The character of Santa Claus is said to be inspired by Saint Nicholas of Myra, a bishop, who went around giving the poor children of his village gifts. The legend of Santa centres around the North Pole and his magical workshop of elves. Every year he makes presents for those children who were nice. Those who were naughty received nothing but a lump of coal. The figure of Santa has become inseparable from the tradition of Christmas on a whole.
