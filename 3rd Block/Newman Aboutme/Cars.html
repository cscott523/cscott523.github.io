		<h2>Rolls-Royce:</h2>
			<p><strong>GHOST EXTENDED WHEELBASE.</strong> Uncompromising, never ordinary – innovative technology and unrivalled engineering make
			driving Ghost intuitive. Effortless. Rooted in simplicity, every detail has a timeless elegance and purity, allowing you to forge a 
			graceful path through an ever-changing world
			Hand-built by more than 60 pairs of hands, the precision and patience our craftspeople put into Ghost make it a masterpiece in its own
			right. From the five coats of paint on the bodyshell to the hand-stitched leatherwork inside, perfection is the benchmark. Anything less 
			just won’t do.
			Instantly recognisable from the front, Ghost has a purposeful stance as it waits to be driven. Integrated LED headlights emit a mystical
			glow, framed by the unbroken daytime running lights. And the subtle sculpting of the bumper – together with the aerodynamic jet air 
			intake-styled front grille – enhance its dynamism. Undeniably streamlined, the fluid lines are accentuated by the Spirit of Ecstasy,
			tilted seven degrees further forward and ready to lead the way as you take to the road.
			Bold and powerful yet remarkably restrained, Ghost is armed with a twin-turbo 6.6-litre V12 engine. Select from five wheel designs and 
			two finishes, each featuring our unique, self-righting wheel centres - so that the Rolls-Royce monogram is always displayed upright.</p>

		<h2>Ferrari:</h2>
			<p><strong>Ferrari 488 GTB.</strong> Designed by the Ferrari Styling Centre, the 488 GTB features very sculptural flanks which are the key
			to its character. Its large signature air intake scallop is a nod to the original 308 GTB and is divided into two sections by a splitter.
			Designed by the Ferrari Styling Centre, the 488 GTB features very sculptural flanks which are the key to its character. Its large signature
			air intake scallop is a nod to the original 308 GTB and is divided into two sections by a splitter. The front is characterised by the dual 
			grille opening which channels air into the two radiators. There is also a double front spoiler which, on close inspection, looks very like
			those of the F1 single-seaters. At the centre two pylons are combined with a deflector which channels air towards the flat underbody.
			The 488 GTB’s cabin was designed to exude extreme sportiness without sacrificing occupant comfort. This heightens the impression of a 
			cockpit tailored around the driver’s needs: the commands not clustered on the steering wheel are on the wraparound satellite pods which are 
			-angled directly towards the driver.
			The new lighter, horizontally more compact dashboard features ultra-sporty air vents inspired by military jet air intakes.</p>
