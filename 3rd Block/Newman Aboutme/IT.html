		<h2>Computer and Information Research Scientist:</h2>
			<p>Computer and information research scientists invent and design new approaches to computing technology and
			find innovative uses for existing technology. They study and solve complex problems in computing for business,
			science, medicine, and other fields. Computer and information research scientists held about 25,600 jobs in 
			2014.Most jobs for computer and information research scientists require a Ph.D. in computer science or a 
			related field. In the federal government, a bachelor’s degree may be sufficient for some jobs. The median 
			annual wage for computer and information research scientists was $110,620 in May 2015. The median wage is the 
			wage at which half the workers in an occupation earned more than that amount and half earned less. The lowest 
			10 percent earned less than $64,300, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $170,610. Employment of
			computer and information research scientists is projected to grow 11 percent from 2014 to 2024, faster than 
			the average for all occupations. The research and development work of computer and information research 
			scientists turns ideas into industry-leading technology. As demand for new and better technology grows, 
			demand for computer scientists will grow as well. Rapid growth in data collection by businesses will lead to an
			increased need for data-mining services. Computer scientists will be needed to write algorithms that help 
			businesses make sense of very large amounts of data. With this information, businesses understand their consumers
			better, making the work of computer and information research scientists increasingly vital. A growing emphasis on
			cybersecurity also should lead to new jobs, because computer scientists will be needed to find innovative ways to 
			prevent cyberattacks. In addition, an increase in demand for software may increase the need for computer 
			scientists who create new programming languages to make software writing more efficient.</p>

		<h2>Software Developers:</h2>
			<p>	Software developers are the creative minds behind computer programs. Some develop the applications that allow 
			people to do specific tasks on a computer or another device. Others develop the underlying systems that run the 
			devices or that control networks. Software developers held about 1.1 million jobs in 2014. Software developers 
			usually have a bachelor’s degree in computer science and strong computer programming skills. The median annual 
			wage for software developers, applications was $98,260 in May 2015. The median wage is the wage at which half 
			the workers in an occupation earned more than that amount and half earned less. The lowest 10 percent earned 
			less than $57,340, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $153,710. Employment of software developers is 
			projected to grow 17 percent from 2014 to 2024, much faster than the average for all occupations. Employment of
			applications developers is projected to grow 19 percent, and employment of systems developers is projected to 
			grow 13 percent. The main reason for the rapid growth in both applications developers and systems developers is 
			a large increase in the demand for computer software.The need for new applications on mobile devices and tablets
			will help increase the demand for application software developers.The health and medical insurance and 
			reinsurance carriers industry will need innovative software to manage new healthcare policy enrollments and 
			administer existing policies digitally. As the number of people who use this digital platform increases over time, 
			demand for software developers will grow.Systems developers are likely to see new opportunities because of an
			increase in the number of products that use software. For example, more computer systems are being built into 
			consumer electronics and other products, such as cell phones and appliances.Concerns over threats to computer 
			security could result in more investment in security software to protect computer networks and electronic 
			infrastructure. In addition, an increase in software offered over the Internet should lower costs and allow more 
			customization for businesses, also increasing demand for software developers.Some outsourcing to foreign countries 
			that offer lower wages may occur. However, because software developers should be close to their customers, the 
			offshoring of this occupation is expected to be limited.</p>

		<h2>Computer Network Architects:</h2>
			<p>Computer network architects design and build data communication networks, including local area networks (LANs), 
			wide area networks (WANs), and intranets. These networks range from small connections between two offices to 
			next-generation networking capabilities such as a cloud infrastructure that serves multiple customers. Network 
			architects must have extensive knowledge of an organization’s business plan to design a network that can help the 
			organization achieve its goals. Computer network architects held about 146,200 jobs in 2014. Most computer network 
			architects have a bachelor’s degree in a computer-related field and experience in a related occupation. The median 
			annual wage for computer network architects was $100,240 in May 2015. The median wage is the wage at which half the 
			workers in an occupation earned more than that amount and half earned less. The lowest 10 percent earned less than 
			$56,230, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $155,250.Employment of computer network architects is projected 
			to grow 9 percent from 2014 to 2024, faster than the average for all occupations.Demand for computer network 
			architects will increase as firms continue to expand their information technology (IT) networks. Designing and 
			building these new networks, as well as upgrading existing ones, will create opportunities for computer network 
			architects. The expansion of healthcare information technology will also contribute to employment growth.Adoption of 
			cloud computing, which allows users to access storage, software, and other computer services over the Internet, is 
			likely to dampen the demand for computer network architects. Organizations will no longer have to design and build 
			networks in-house; instead, firms that provide cloud services will do this. Smaller firms with minimal IT requirements 
			will find it more cost effective to outsource their reliance on IT to cloud service providers. However, because 
			architects at cloud providers can work on more than one organization’s network, these providers will not have to 
			employ as many architects as individual organizations do for the same amount of work.</p>
