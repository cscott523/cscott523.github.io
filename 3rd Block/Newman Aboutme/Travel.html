		<h2>Thailand:</h2>
			<p>A unified Thai kingdom was established in the mid-14th century. Known as Siam until 1939, Thailand is the only
			Southeast Asian country never to have been colonized by a European power. A bloodless revolution in 1932 led to 
			the establishment of a constitutional monarchy. In alliance with Japan during World War II, Thailand became a US
			treaty ally in 1954 after sending troops to Korea and later fighting alongside the US in Vietnam. Thailand since
			2005 has experienced several rounds of political turmoil including a military coup in 2006 that ousted then Prime
			Minister THAKSIN Chinnawat, followed by large-scale street protests by competing political factions in 2008, 2009,
			and 2010. THAKSIN's youngest sister, YINGLAK Chinnawat, in 2011 led the Puea Thai Party to an electoral win and
			assumed control of the government.
			A blanket amnesty bill for individuals involved in street protests, altered at the last minute to include all
			political crimes - including all convictions against THAKSIN - triggered months of large-scale anti-government
			protests in Bangkok beginning in November 2013. In early May 2014 YINGLAK was removed from office by the
			Constitutional Court and in late May 2014 the Royal Thai Army staged a coup against the caretaker government.
			The head of the Royal Thai Army, Gen. PRAYUT Chan-ocha, was appointed prime minister in August 2014. The interim 
			military government created several interim institutions to promote reform and draft a new constitution. Elections
			are tentatively set for mid-2017. Thailand has also experienced violence associated with the ethno-nationalist
			insurgency in its southern Malay-Muslim majority provinces. Since January 2004, thousands have been killed and
			wounded in the insurgency.</p>

		<h2>India:</h2>
			<p>The Indus Valley civilization, one of the world's oldest, flourished during the 3rd and 2nd millennia B.C. and
			extended into northwestern India. Aryan tribes from the northwest infiltrated the Indian subcontinent about 1500 
			B.C.; their merger with the earlier Dravidian inhabitants created the classical Indian culture. The Maurya Empire
			of the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C. - which reached its zenith under ASHOKA - united much of South Asia. The Golden 
			Age ushered in by the Gupta dynasty (4th to 6th centuries A.D.) saw a flowering of Indian science, art, and culture.
			Islam spread across the subcontinent over a period of 700 years. In the 10th and 11th centuries, Turks and Afghans
			invaded India and established the Delhi Sultanate. In the early 16th century, the Emperor BABUR established the Mughal
			Dynasty, which ruled India for more than three centuries. European explorers began establishing footholds in India 
			during the 16th century.
			By the 19th century, Great Britain had become the dominant political power on the subcontinent. The British Indian 
			Army played a vital role in both World Wars. Years of nonviolent resistance to British rule, led by Mohandas GANDHI
			and Jawaharlal NEHRU, eventually resulted in Indian independence, which was granted in 1947. Large-scale communal 
			violence took place before and after the subcontinent partition into two separate states - India and Pakistan. The
			neighboring nations have fought three wars since independence, the last of which was in 1971 and resulted in East 
			Pakistan becoming the separate nation of Bangladesh. India's nuclear weapons tests in 1998 emboldened Pakistan to 
			conduct its own tests that same year. In November 2008, terrorists originating from Pakistan conducted a series of 
			coordinated attacks in Mumbai, India's financial capital. Despite pressing problems such as significant overpopulation,
			environmental degradation, extensive poverty, and widespread corruption, economic growth following the launch of economic
			reforms in 1991 and a massive youthful population are driving India's emergence as a regional and global power.</p>

		<h2>Italy:</h2>
			<p>Italy became a nation-state in 1861 when the regional states of the peninsula, along with Sardinia and Sicily, were
			united under King Victor EMMANUEL II. An era of parliamentary government came to a close in the early 1920s when Benito 
			MUSSOLINI established a Fascist dictatorship. His alliance with Nazi Germany led to Italy's defeat in World War II. A
			democratic republic replaced the monarchy in 1946 and economic revival followed. Italy is a charter member of NATO and
			the European Economic Community (EEC). It has been at the forefront of European economic and political unification, 
			joining the Economic and Monetary Union in 1999. Persistent problems include sluggish economic growth, high youth and
			female unemployment, organized crime, corruption, and economic disparities between southern Italy and the more prosperous north.</p>
