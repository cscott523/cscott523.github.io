	<p>Have you ever wandered what the first christmas song was. Have you ever wondered who wrote the first christmas song well heres answere youve all been waiting for. Carols were first sung in europe thousands of years ago but these were not Christmas Carols. they were pagan songs sung at the winter celebrations as people danced around stone circles. (the word carol otiginally meant to dance to something.) The winter solstice is the shortest day of the year usually taking place around the 22nd december. the word carol dance on a song of praise and joy.
