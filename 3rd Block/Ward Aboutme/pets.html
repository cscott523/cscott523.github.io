	<!-- 
		paragraph 1

	<p> I have a dog named Morgan, its a cockapoo which is a Cocker Spaniel and a Poodle mix. I got him for Christmas when i was 7.When we 
	bought Morgan he was a puppy and was just able to be taken from his mother when we got him. He is getting pretty olf in age for his 
	breed of dogs, he cannot see or hear very well and in the winter his legs dont work well. I also have a boxer named RUger whichis a
	dog they got formy brother.We got Ruger from one of  my dads friends when he was a puppy.one day he ran away and we couldnt find him 
	and he had been taken to the pound so then we had to go buy  him back from the pound.

	<p>
		Where I live on a farm we also have cows, Horses and we used to have goats. My dad normally does most of the work with them 
		but when i was little i used to ride the horses alot. I also got one of the horses for  Christmas one year his name is Tucky 
		and my grandma gave him to me. He is getting pretty old to and is no longer able to ride because of old age and joint pain. 
	<!-- 
		paragraph 3
	-->
	<p>
	We also have two cats that showed up at our hosue but we then kept to feed and take care of, they dont have names though. One 
		is super little and solid greyish color and the other is a mingled with black brown and orange looking color. We also had a Solid
		white cat with blue eyes but we then gave it to my aunt.
