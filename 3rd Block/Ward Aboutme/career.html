				<td><h2>What is a software developer</h2>
				<br>
				A software developer is a person concerned 
				with the software development process,
				including the research, design, programming,
				and testing 
				of computer software.You might
				expect software developers to sit at their desks
				designing programs all day – and they do,
				but their job involves many more 
				responsibilities.
				Software developers 
				also check for bugs in software. software 
				developers have to work with others,
				including other developers, management or 
				clients. Developers are often natural problem 
				solvers who have strong analytical skills
				and the ability to think outside the box.</td>
				
				<td><center><h2>Pay</h2></center>
				<br>
				A software developer's average salary, $99,530, is 
				higher than most other jobs  on our technology 
				jobs list. For instance, a software developer made 
				thousands more than computer systems analysts, who 
				made an average salary of $87,320 in 2014, and computer 
				programmers, who made about $82,690.The computer systems 
				design industry and software publishers employ the 
				highest number of software engineers, but the highest-paid
				positions are in the San Francisco Bay Area cities San Jose
				and San Francisco, as well as in Seattle.



				</td>
				<td><h2>Nature Of Work</h2>
				<br>
				Many software developers work for firms that deal in computer
				systems design and related services firms or for software
				publishers. Some systems developers work in computer- and 
				electronic product–manufacturing industries. Applications 
				developers work in office environments, such as offices of 
				insurance carriers or corporate headquarters.
				In general, software development is a collaborative process,
				and developers work on teams with others who also contribute 
				to designing, developing, and programming successful software.
				However, some developers telecommute (work away from the office).

					<td><center><h2>Training and Education Required</h2></center>
					Computer software developers apply mathematic and scientific 
					principles to the design and development of software systems 
					and applications. The minimum educational requirement is a 
					bachelor's degree, and certification may be necessary.
					These programs have significant math requirements that
					include a sequence in calculus, differential equations, and 
					linear algebra. A sequence in physics is also required. 
					Students typically complete these requirements in the first
					two years of a program.
					</td>
					
					<td><h2>Job Outlook</h2>
					Employment of software developers is projected to grow 17 percent
					from 2014 to 2024, much faster than the average for all occupations.
					Employment of applications developers is projected to grow 19 percent,
					and employment of systems developers is projected to grow 13 percent.
					The main reason for the rapid growth in both applications developers 
					and systems developers is a large increase in the demand for computer 
					software.The need for new applications on mobile devices and tablets
					will help increase the demand for application software developers.
