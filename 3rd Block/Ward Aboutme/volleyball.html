<h1> What is Volleyball?</h1>
	<p>Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are on dofferent sides of a net.
		Each team tries to score points by hittinig a ball on the other team's court under 
		organized rules. Only the serving team may score a point, except in the deciding game 
		when a rally-point scoring is used. When the receiving team wins a rally, it gives the 
		right to serve also scoring a point, and its players rotate one position clockwise. 
		Rotatation makes sure that players play at both the net and the back zone of the court.A team wins a game by scoring 25 points with a two-point advantage and
		wins the match by winning the best of two or three games. In the event of a 25-25 tie,
		the team scoring the 27th point wins a game.</p>

<h1>History of volleyball</h1>
	<P>the history of volleyball. On February 9, 1895, in Holyoke, Massachusetts, William Morgan
		a YMCA physical education director, created a new game called Mintonette as a game to be
		played  indoors and by any number of players. The game took some of its characteristics 
		from tennis and handball.So, he borrowed. From basketball, he took the ball. From tennis the net. 
		The use of hands and the ability to play off the walls and over hangs, he borrowed from handball.
		And, from baseball, he took the concept of innings.He termed this new game "Mintonette". And though
		admittedly incomplete, it proved successful enough to win an audience at the YMCA Physical Director's
		Conference held in Springfield, Massachusetts the next year.It was at this conference that Dr. Alfred
		Halstead, a professor at Springfield College, suggested a two-word version of its present name. "Volley
		Ball". And we still play it today!
