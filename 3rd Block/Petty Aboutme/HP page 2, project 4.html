<h1> <i>Alpha H1 </h1>

<P><i>The Hummer H1 Alpha was a one-year production model of the regular H1 that featured a handful of important mechanical changes.
A more powerful engine, another gear for the transmission and bigger brakes greatly improved performance over the non-Alpha H1
and made the beast the best it had ever been.

<a name="r1" /><p> Then came the Hummer H3. It was designed to be the "real world" Hummer: less pyrotechnics and more sparklers.
he H3's styling still proclaimed loudly that it's a card-carrying member of the Hummer guild, and the truck had 
more off-road capability than just about every other midsize SUV when the pavement ends.

<h1> <i>Off-Road H3 </h1>
<img width="500" height="400" src="About me pics/hummer.jpg"/>
<p>The Hummer H2 debuted in 2003 as an attempt by Hummer and parent company General Motors to offer something 
a bit more practical than the exotic, designed-for-military-use H1.When examined solely on these merits, the H2
 seemed like the ultimate pick for an SUV.
