						My future career will be a software developer at google; or a game developer at bethesda studios. Software developers make software for end users so depending on what the company
						asigns the programmer to make. They build various types of software, or modify existing software to keep it updated with the latest tech. Game developers help develop video games, depending
						on what the company needs you might be creating models or you might be programming the game itself. They are both high paying jobs which take a lot of skill to get into. However most good programmers
						can get a job at either one of this companies. It all depends on what you are skilled in.
						Software developers include two primary categories, according to the BLS: Applications developers earned median annual wage of $90,060 in 2012, while systems developers took home $99,000 per year. 
						The profession will grow 22 percent between 2012 and 2022, and add 222,600 jobs to the U.S.
